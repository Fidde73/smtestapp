You can use this to test MiCCE vb macros.
The result will be printed to the console and the code from "sm.vb" can just be pasted in the macro
The smscriptbox emulate the SM functions, you can add varibles to use in the AddDebugVaribles function 

If you add refrences, they need to be included in the VB-scriptblock. Be carful if you ussing MiCCE varibles of other types and string, the test app will not trough any errors on that
